- JavaScript
- SQL

## LISP

**LISP** is the second oldest programming language in the world (1958), one year younger than Fortran (1957).

The term **Artificial Intelligence** was made up by **John McCarthy** who invented LISP.

## R

R is a programming language for **Graphics** and **Statistical** computing.

R comes with a wide set of statistical and graphical techniques for:

- Linear Modeling
- Nonlinear Modeling
- Statistical Tests
- Time-series Analysis
- Classification
- Clustering

## Python

**Python** is typically used for server development, like building web apps for web servers.

Python is also typically used in **Data Science**.

An advantage for using Python is that it comes with some very suitable libraries:

- NumPy (Library for working with Arrays)
- SciPy (Library for Statistical Science)
- Matplotlib (Graph Plotting Library)
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- TensorFlow (Machine Learning)

## C++

**C++** holds the title: **"The worlds fastest programming language"**.

Because of the speed, C++ is a preferred language when programming Computer Games.

Google uses C++ in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning programs for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

**SHARK** is a super-fast C++ library with support for supervised learning algorithms, linear regression, neural networks, and clustering.

**MLPACK** is also a super-fast machine learning library for C++.

## Java

**Java** is another general-purpose coding language that can be used for all types of software development.

For Machine Learning, Java is mostly used to create algorithms, and neural networks.

## SQL

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the most popular language for managing data.

Knowledge of SQL databases, tables and queries helps data scientists when dealing with data.

SQL is very convenient for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.
