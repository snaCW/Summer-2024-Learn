## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence suggest that machines can mimic humans in:

- Talking
- Thinking
- Learning
- Planning
- Understanding

Other various definitions:

- Arthur Samuel 1959:
    > "Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed"
- Wikipedia 2022:
    > Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines. Unlike natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.
- Investopedia 2022:
    > Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
- IBM 2022:
    > Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.
- Britannica 2022:
    > Artificial intelligence is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings, .... such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Artificial Intelligence** is a scientific discipline embracing several Data Science fields ranging from narrow AI to strong AI, including machine learning, deep learning, big data and data mining.

## Narrow AI

**Narrow Artificial Intelligence** is limited to narrow (specific) areas like most of the AI we have around us today.

**Narrow AI** is also called **Weak AI**.

Weak AI: Built to **simulate** human intelligence.

## Strong AI

**Strong Artificial Intelligence** is the type of AI that mimics human intelligence.

Strong AI indicates the ability to think, plan, learn, and communicate.

Strong AI is the theoretical next level of AI: True Intelligence.

Strong AI moves towards machines with self-awareness, consciousness, and objective thoughts.
