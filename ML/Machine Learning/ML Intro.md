## Machine Learning (ML)

Traditional programming **uses algorithms** to produce results from data:
> Data + Algorithm = **Results**

Machine Learning **creates algorithms** from data and results:
> Data + Results = **Algorithms**

## Neural Networks (NN)

**Neural Networks** is:

- A programming technique
- A method used in machine learning
- A software that learns from mistakes

**Neural Networks** are based on how the human brain works.

## Perceptrons

It represents a single neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are Multi-Layer Perceptrons.

In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:

- An input layer
- A hidden layer
- An output layer

**The First Layer:**

The perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input. Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.

**The Second Layer:**

The perceptrons are making decisions by weighing the results from the first layer. This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.

## Deep Neural Networks

Deep Neural Networks are made up of several hidden layers of neural networks that perform complex operations on massive amounts of data.

Each successive layer uses the preceding layer as input.

It has more layers.

## Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.

|      Machine Learning     |        Deep Learning         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| A subset of AI            | A subset of Machine Learning |
| Uses smaller data sets    | Uses larger datasets         |
| Trained by humans         | Learns on its own            |
| Creates simple algorithms | Creates complex algorithms   |
