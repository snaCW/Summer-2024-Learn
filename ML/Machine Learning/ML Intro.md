## Machine Learning (ML)

Traditional programming **uses algorithms** to produce results from data:
> Data + Algorithm = **Results**

Machine Learning **creates algorithms** from data and results:
> Data + Results = **Algorithms**

## Neural Networks (NN)

**Neural Networks** is:

- A programming technique
- A method used in machine learning
- A software that learns from mistakes

**Neural Networks** are based on how the human brain works.

## Perceptrons

It represents a single neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are Multi-Layer Perceptrons.

In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:

- An input layer
- A hidden layer
- An output layer

**The First Layer:**

The perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input. Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.

**The Second Layer:**

The perceptrons are making decisions by weighing the results from the first layer. This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.
