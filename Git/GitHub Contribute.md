## GitHub Fork
A `fork` is a copy of a repository. `fork` is not available in Git, it's something only in GitHub and other repository hosts.

## Git Clone from GitHub
A `clone` is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.

To `clone` a repository at GitHub, you click on the green "Code" button and get the `URL`. Then open your Git bash and `clone` the repository: `git clone {URL}`

By looking at your file system, you can see the new directory: `ls`
